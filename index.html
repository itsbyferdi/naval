              As an angel investor, Naval Ravikant faced challenges like the
              fragmented and time-consuming nature of discovering startups,
              conducting due diligence, and managing investments. Moreover,
              access to top-tier deals was often restricted to a select group of
              well-connected individuals.
            </p>
            <p class="body">
              Naval saw an opportunity to democratize startup investing by
              making it more transparent and accessible to a broader audience.
              In 2010, they launched AngelList, a platform designed to
              streamline the fundraising and investing process. Initially, it
              served as a directory for startups and investors, allowing
              entrepreneurs to showcase their projects and investors to discover
              new opportunities.

              Airchat, was inspired by the need for deeper, more meaningful
              communication during the COVID-19 pandemic. Noticing the
              superficial nature of existing social media platforms, Naval
              envisioned a space for authentic voice conversations, free from
              the pressures of polished content. Unlike other platforms, Airchat
              prioritized substance over style, allowing users to engage in
              spontaneous, real-time discussions.
            </p>
            <p class="body">
              Airchat emphasized privacy, offering a space free from intrusive

              quickly attracted a diverse community of tech enthusiasts,
              entrepreneurs, artists, and thinkers.

              The creation of "Naval's Almanack" was an organic journey, born
              from Naval Ravikant's shared insights on life, technology, and

              podcast transcripts, and essays into a modern-day almanac. Naval's
              Almanack explores wealth creation, happiness, personal growth, and
              more, reflecting Naval's unique perspectives. It offers timeless

                In January 2005, Ravikant and three co-founders sued Benchmark,

                Naval re-entered venture capital with Venture Hacks, a blog
                co-founded with Babak Nivi that exposed the game theory of
                fundraising to entrepreneurs.

                By 2009, Naval’s blog had grown tremendously in popularity. He
                then started a fund called The Hit Forge.

                A defining moment came when Naval, around 35, met an investor
                friend who offered him a deal.

                That encounter sparked the idea for AngelList, revealing that
                many investors and startups were unaware of each other.
                Partnering again with Babak Nivi, they created a list of 25
                investors to keep updated on startup opportunities.

            <div class="bubble-chat-receive">
              <p>
                This eventually grew to two lists – AngelList and StartupList.
                In 2010, with a list of 50 Angel Investors willing to invest $80
                million in start-ups, Naval launched AngelList. His biggest
                success to date

                  Oh wow. I didn’t realize that there are setbacks in his
                  journey before finding AngelList. Thank you for sharing his
